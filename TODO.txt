These changes must happen, as they seem important.

* Move from 32-bit to 8-bit instructions
* Make all Jumps jump static in code
* Add proper instructions (looking at x86 and amd64)
* Add registers (again, x86 and amd64)
* Add 64-bit stack (for floats)
* Abstract Bytecode to now have hex and dec bytecode values
  * This must be easy enough to extremely simplify the assembler
* Add jump support to BrainFuck compiler to finalize
* Section/Label definitions
* Section calls
* Label jumps

Maybe this would be nice.

* Proper cross-Unix support. Run on Linux (GNU and LLVM; Gentoo, Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL), *BSD, (Darwin?)

For far far future.

* Simplest possible Lua to Bytecode compiler.
* Simplest possible own language to Bytecode compiler.
